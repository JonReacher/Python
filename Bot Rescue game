🤖 Botland Rescue 🤖

The Story:
Tiny bots have been trapped in a maze! Your mission? Help 'em find their way out, dodging obstacles and picking up energy cells for a power boost. ⚡

Graphical Elements:

    🟩 A 2D grid to represent the maze
    🟥 Square blocks for walls
    🟦 Dots or small squares for bots
    🌟 Stars or other simple shapes for energy cells

Core Game Mechanics:

    🕹️ Player controls a 'rescue bot' using arrow keys.
    🤝 Rescue bots and move them to a designated 'safe zone'.
    ⭐ Pick up energy cells to gain extra moves or abilities.
    🚫 Avoid or navigate around obstacles.

Python Learning Points:

    💻 Using PyGame's basic functions for graphics and control
    🧱 Object-oriented programming (OOP) to represent bots, walls, and other elements
    🧠 Basic AI algorithms for bot movement (e.g., simple pathfinding)
    🎮 Event handling for controls
    🛑 Collision detection

Steps to Develop:

    Grid & Basic Movement: Start by rendering a basic 2D grid and a controllable square representing the player's 'rescue bot'.
    Obstacles & Walls: Add static walls or blocks to serve as obstacles in the maze.
    Bot Placement: Randomly place tiny bots in the maze.
    Safe Zone: Designate an area or point as the 'safe zone' where bots need to be guided.
    Energy Cells: Add these to the grid, giving the rescue bot extra moves or temporary powers when picked up.
    Simple Bot AI: Give the tiny bots basic movement patterns until they're rescued.
    Scoring: Add a point system based on how many bots are rescued and how many energy cells are picked up.

The simplicity of this game allows for a focus on the coding skills while leaving room for creativity. Plus, the game naturally introduces some robotics concepts like pathfinding and obstacle navigation. It also allows for fun!!
