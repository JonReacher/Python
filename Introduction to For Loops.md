In this lesson, we will learn about for loops in Python, which are used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or range). We will cover the basic syntax and how to use for loops to perform repetitive tasks.

1) Basic syntax of a for loop:

```
for variable in sequence:
    # code to execute
```

2) Using a for loop to iterate over a list:

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

3) Using a for loop with the range() function:

```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

4) Exercise: Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list using a for loop.
